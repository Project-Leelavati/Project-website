        <h3>INTRODUCTION TO VEDIC MATHEMATICS
            AND THE BOOK</h3>
        <pre>● Vedic Mathematics finds its roots in ancient Indian scriptures known as the Vedas.
            These mathematical techniques were developed over thousands of years and were
            originally used for religious rituals and daily life.

            ● Techniques: Vedic Mathematics comprises a set of unique mathematical methods and
            shortcuts for performing calculations quickly and efficiently. These techniques often
            involve mental arithmetic and are based on fundamental mathematical principles.

            ● Influence: "Lilavati" incorporates some Vedic mathematical principles alongside
            conventional methods, demonstrating the integration of different mathematical
            traditions in ancient India.</pre>

        <h3>ABOUT THE AUTHOR</h3>
        <pre>● Bhaskaracharya: Also known as Bhaskara II, he was a prominent
            mathematician and astronomer who lived during the 12th century in India.
            Bhaskaracharya made significant contributions to various branches of
            mathematics, including algebra, arithmetic, geometry, and calculus.

            ● Lilavati is the first part of Bhaskaracharya’s work Siddhantashiromani.

            ● Lilavati: Bhaskaracharya named his mathematical treatise "Lilavati" after his
            daughter. Legend has it that he wrote this book to teach Lilavati
            mathematics after she faced disappointment due to a prediction about her
            marriage</pre>

            human history and encourages further exploration of mathematical concepts and
            techniques.</pre>

        <h3>PROJECT IDEA</h3>
        <pre>● This project aims to build a python library which would consist of functions which
            solve the mathematical problems in the methods described in the Lilavati book.

            ● The main objective of this project is to emphasise on ancient mathematical problem
            solving techniques and make it accessible to the programming community.

            ● This is an intensive coding project which involves interpreting the sanskrit slokas and
            converting it into code to solve a given problem.

            ● The libraries further has two sub libraries- Algebra and geometry which can be
            imported by the user according to the objective.

            ● The project has two versions to it. The first version released solves few problems from
            specific chapters. In the next version, we aim to build a complete tutorial library to
            lilavati where the users will be guided on the methods and algorithms used in Lilavati.</pre>

        <h3>UNIQUENESS OF THE PROJECT</h3>
        <pre>● Though there are other mathematical libraries available, Lilavati is unique in a way that it
            solves the problem according to the ancient method.

            ● Also, there are few problems like sum of permutations given in the book which cannot be
            solved using modern mathematical methods.

            ● Example:
            In "Lilavati," "Vedic Square Root, is proposed which allows for the calculation of square roots
            using mental arithmetic and simple steps which can be used to find square roots efficiently and for a
            wide range of numbers.
            While Python's math module provides functions like math.sqrt() to calculate square roots, it
            relies on numerical methods and algorithms, such as Newton's method, to approximate the square
            root of a given number. These methods involve iterative calculations and may not always yield exact
            results, especially for irrational numbers or non-perfect squares.</pre>

        <h3>TECH STACKS</h3>
        <pre>Python:
            Creating a Python library based on "Lilavati" could offer several advantages:
            1) Accessibility: Python is a widely used programming language known for its
            simplicity and readability.
            
            2) Computational Power: Python provides powerful computational capabilities
            through its extensive libraries and modules. By implementing "Lilavati"
            algorithms and techniques in Python, users can leverage the computational
            power of the language.
            
            3) Interactivity: Python's interactive nature makes it suitable for experimentation
            and exploration. By creating a Python library, users can interactively explore
            mathematical concepts from "Lilavati," test different scenarios, and visualize
            results using libraries like Matplotlib or NumPy.
            
            4) Integration: Python can easily integrate with other technologies and platforms, making it
            suitable for incorporating "Lilavati" algorithms into various applications and environments.
            Whether it's integrating with web applications, scientific computing tools, or educational
            platforms, Python offers flexibility and compatibility.
            
            5) Community Support: Python has a vast and active community of developers, educators,
            and researchers. By creating a Python library based on "Lilavati," developers can tap into
            this community for collaboration, feedback, and contributions, fostering the growth and
            evolution of the library over time.
            
            Overall, leveraging Python to create a library based on "Lilavati" can help democratize
            access to ancient mathematical knowledge, empower users with computational tools, and
            foster collaboration and innovation in the field of mathematics and education.</pre>
